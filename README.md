# FiveM Parking Lights

**What does this script do?**
This script was built for the LEO Devs that wanted to add different patterns for cars that are parked/stopped compared to driving.

**How do I config it?**
- Copy the first vehicle shown
- Change the parkExtras to whatever needs to be turned on when it's parked
- Change the drivingExtras to whatever they need to be when it's driving
- Change the spawncode of the vehicle in the `GetHashKey('police')`

# This is meant to be a really simple script for you guys to use and for the devs to make awesome vehicles :)
